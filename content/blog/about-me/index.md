### Hi! My name is Gabriel Kuettel. I'm a full stack web developer with a background in graphic design, branding and marketing.

I began my journey as a developer and designer working for Gold Standard, a non-profit focused on reducing carbon emissions by certifying climate and sustainable development projects. I spearheaded the 'digitization' of their standard, Gold Standard for the Global Goals, by building the <a target="_blank" href="https://globalgoals.goldstandard.org">Project Developer portal</a> - an online portal for technical documentation, training videos, and additional resources, used by over 1,700 climate and sustainable development projects.

I'm currently working as a Software Engineer for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sans.org/">SANS Institute</a>. In my free time, I'm working on <a target="_blank" href="https://gitcamp.net">gitCamp</a> - an open-source collaboration platform for students built using the github API.

Looking for someone to build blazing fast, scalable, and intuitive web apps for your business or non-profit? <a href="mailto:gabrielkuettel@gmail.com">Let's talk!</a>
