### Hi! My name is Gabriel. I'm a fullstack web developer with a background in graphic design, branding and marketing.

I have a knack for designing and developing robust and user-friendly applications and websites using modern build tools. 

I cut my teeth as a designer and developer working for Gold Standard, a non-profit focused on reducing carbon emissions by certifying climate and sustainable development projects. I spearheaded the 'digitization' of their standard, Gold Standard for the Global Goals, by building the [Project Developer portal](https://globalgoals.goldstandard.org) - an online portal for technical documentation, training videos, and additional resources, used by over 1,7000 climate and sustainable development projects. 

I love combining my passion for climate action and the environment with my skills as a developer, and would like to <a href="mailto:gabrielkuettel@gmail.com.com">chat</a> with you if you have a project that tackles those challenges or if you work in that space.

In my free time, I'm working on <a href="http://gitcamp.herokuapp.com">gitCamp</a> - an open-source collaboration platform for students built using the github API. 

Looking for someone to build blazing fast, scalable, and intuitive web apps for your business or non-profit? <a href="mailto:gabrielkuettel@gmail.com.com">Let's talk!</a>
