### Hi! My name is Gabriel. I'm a fullstack web developer with a background in graphic design, branding and marketing.

I'm currently helping to teach new developers at the University of Denver's Coding Bootcamp. In my free time, I'm working on <a href="http://gitcamp.herokuapp.com">gitCamp</a> - an open-source collaboration platform for students built on the github API.

I love building blazing fast, mobile-first, and scalable web apps for small businesses and non-profits. <a href="mailto:gabrielkuettel@gmail.com.com">Hire me</a> for your next project!
