Feature animation developed for <a href="https://goldstandard.org">SustainCERT</a> to commemorate the launch of Gold Standard for the Global Goals, a new standard for climate and development projects. I created the animation using Adobe After Effects, Adobe Illustrator for static assets, and Adobe Premiere Pro for editing.
