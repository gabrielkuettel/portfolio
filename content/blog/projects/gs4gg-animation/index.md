> Feature animation for <a href="https://goldstandard.org">Gold Standard for the Global Goals</a> 

### Project Background

To commemorate the launch of Gold Standard for the Global Goals, a new standard for climate and development projects, I was tasked with creating a feature animation that both advertised and informed clients of the key features of the new standard.

I created the animation using Adobe After Effects, Adobe Illustrator for static assets, and Adobe Premiere Pro for editing.
