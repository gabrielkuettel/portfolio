gitCamp is a student collaboration platform integrated with GitHub's API. I built gitCamp using Node.js, Express, PassportJS for authentication, Mongoose as an ODM for MongoDB, and React to create a dynamic and decoupled frontend client.

#### Project Background

My favorite part of attending the University of Denver's Fullstack Coding Bootcamp were the group projects. Working with my fellow students to create fullstack applications with the exciting new technologies we were learning was a fun and rewarding experience. However, during the collaboration process, I felt there was some friction, as we struggled to fully integrate a git-based workflow in how we worked together - at least in the beginning!

I created gitCamp to solve this problem. By distilling the most essential parts of git-based workflows, gitCamp gives students an intuitive introduction to git, and lets them work together to create amazing projects in a friction-free environment. GitCamp allows students to create projects, invite collaborats, and create, manage, and assign tasks.

And the best part? It's fully integrated with GitHub. Projects created in gitCamp are also mirrored on gitHub as repositories. Tasks and their collaborators are created as issues. And students can invite their GitHub followers (or followees) to collobrate with them on GitCamp.
