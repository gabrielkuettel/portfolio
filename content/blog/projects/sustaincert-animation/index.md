> Feature animation for <a href="https://sustain-cert.com">SustainCERT</a>

### Project Background

To announce the launch of SustainCERT, I was tasked with creating a feature animation that encapsulated the forward-looking vision of the company.

I created the animation using Adobe After Effects, Adobe Illustrator for static assets, and Adobe Premiere Pro for editing.
