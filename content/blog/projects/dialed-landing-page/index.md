> Landing page built for Dialed.ai

### Project Background

Dialed.ai is a platform designed to bring clarity and focus to your work. To advertise early access, the Dialed team was looking for a stophisticated-yet-minimalist landing page that teased their product features and highlighted its brand values.

### Built With

I built the Dialed landing page using Jekyll, a Ruby-based static site generator. The graphics and brand assets were designed in Adobe Illustrator. The static comps were designed in Adobe XD.
