The Gold Standard for the Global Goals (GS4GG) Portal is a feature-rich Wordpress portal for project developers who are certifying their projects through Gold Standard. I developed the website using Wordpress/PHP and Advanced Custom Fields to handle the business logic. I built the frontend template from the ground-up using Adobe Muse.
